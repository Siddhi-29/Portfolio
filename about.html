		<h2>Siddhi Pandey</h2>
		<p>
			Welcome! I’m <strong>Siddhi</strong>, currently working as a <strong>Programmer
				at Fidelity International</strong>. With a strong foundation in Java and
			Spring Boot, I’m expanding my expertise in cloud-native technologies,
			performance optimization, and observability.
		</p>

		<p>
			In my current role, I collaborate with cross-functional teams to
			improve backend systems. I’m actively involved in <strong>migrating
				logs from traditional databases to the ELK stack</strong> for enhanced log
			analysis and traceability. I also work on the <strong>migration
				of Spring Boot applications from PaaS environments to Kubernetes
				(K8s)</strong>, focusing on cloud readiness, reliability, and scalability.
		</p>

		<p>
			As part of this cloud-native transformation, I’ve gained hands-on
			experience with <strong>Docker</strong> for containerizing services
			and streamlining deployments. I enjoy conducting deep-dive analysis
			of Spring Boot services and ELK-based log pipelines to identify
			performance bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			I’m also currently participating in the <strong>Google AI
				Exchange Program</strong>, expanding my understanding of cutting-edge AI
			technologies and how they can be integrated into real-world
			applications.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			My journey is fueled by curiosity, continuous learning, and a passion
			for building efficient, robust systems that stand the test of scale.
			Whether it's improving infrastructure, enhancing logs, or rethinking
			architectures, I aim to bridge the gap between reliability and
			innovation<strong>—one commit at a time</strong>.
